This is a specification for recognizing contributors to our open source projects in a way that rewards each and every contribution, not just code.

The basic idea is this:<br>
`Use the project README (or another prominent public documentation page in the project) to recognize the contributions of members of the project community.`

People are giving themselves and their free time to contribute to open source projects in so many ways, so we believe everyone should be praised for their contributions (code or not).
